This project focuses on predicting wind turbine power output using machine learning based on meteorological factors such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity. It helps analyze how weather conditions impact power generation and supports operational planning for wind farms.

What has been done in this project?
✅ Data Collection and Preparation

Collected hourly weather and power generation data from operational wind turbines.

Cleaned and prepared the dataset for machine learning modeling.

✅ Feature Selection and Analysis

Performed correlation analysis to identify key meteorological factors influencing power generation.

Visualized trends and relationships using scatter plots and heatmaps.

✅ Machine Learning Model Building

Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict wind turbine power output using selected weather variables.

Evaluated the model using metrics like RMSE and scatter plots to ensure accurate predictions.

✅ Electricity Production Estimation

Estimated electricity production by multiplying predicted power output by a scaling constant to calculate total energy generated.

✅ GUI Development

Created an interactive Streamlit-based GUI to:

Input weather variables for prediction.

Display predicted power output and estimated electricity production.

Visualize historical trends, feature correlations, and model performance.

✅ Visualization for Insights

Developed graphs and heatmaps to understand the data and model predictions visually.

Included feature importance plots to interpret which factors contribute most to power generation.

Project Outcomes
✅ Understand how weather impacts wind power generation.
✅ Accurately predict wind turbine power output using machine learning.
✅ Provide a user-friendly GUI for visualization and prediction.
✅ Support operational and planning decisions in wind energy management.
